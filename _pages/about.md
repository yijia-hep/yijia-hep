I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and astrophysics. In the past, I worked on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station to study the origin of cosmic rays. I recently started a tenure-track faculty position at the Institute of High Energy Physics, where I conduct supernova neutrino research with the Jiangmen Neutrino Underground Observatory (JUNO).
