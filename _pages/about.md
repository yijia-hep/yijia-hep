I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and astrophysics. 

I am currently an Associate Professor at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), working on the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). I use neutrinos as messegers to probe supernova explosion mechanisms and search for new physics. My research focuses on the first detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), development of a supernova early warning system and data analysis pipeline, and the advancement of numerical simulations of supernovae. I aim to contribute to major breakthroughs in neutrino physics, supernova research, and multi-messenger astronomy.
 
In the past, I worked on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station to study the origin of cosmic rays. During my time in Professor Samuel Ting’s group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I participated in both detector development and physics analysis for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment. My work contributed to several key advances: I developed a new charge reconstruction method that improved the charge resolution of AMS by more than a factor of two, supporting the collaboration’s groundbreaking results in heavy cosmic ray nuclei (published in five Physical Review Letters). I led studies on the time evolution of cosmic rays, including crucial data analysis of protons and helium nuclei, which resulted in six AMS collaboration papers on solar physics (Physical Review Letters). I also led the analysis of the origin of lithium isotopes, which was published in Physical Review Letters and selected as an Editors’ Suggestion.
